# STM32 Morpho Expansion Board for HOMERACK

Not really ready to talk about the project, but it was inspired by the
[kha](https://github.com/kiu/kha) project by WHO? This is just the beginning of the project, but I
decided to start with a STM32 Nucleo-64 board and work from there. This
is just a breakout for a bunch of the IO to a lot of JST PH connectors.
